# Boise State Admission and Scholarship Calculator
This plugin uses two shortcodes: [calc type =""] & [calc type="scholarship"]
To use the plugin, you must first configure the settings and set the "low", "middle", and "high" score messages. This can be done under 'Settings > Admission Calculator' and 'Settings > Scholarship Calculator'.
